<h1 class="title">Cli Apps Database App. A Bird’s Eye View</h1>
        pre.sourceCode { margin: 1; }</header>
<p>This is a short post but, I think, an important one.<br />
At least important to understand the <em>database_app’s</em>
logic.<br />
As the other posts on this theme tend to delve deep into each of the
parts of the app, here I aims to show how they interact and, hopefully,
explain why the app has this structure and not another.</p>
<p>As I said in another post, the overarching aim for the app was to
find a new search paradigm, that did more than consume data in database
approved formats, to one that leverages the syncretic nature of human
thinking.<br />
If a database encourages, and quite rightly so, an analytical and
compartmentalized view of information, we, as humans, think in free, and
not so free, associations, with explanations binding disparate pieces
information, using processes that are experimental, failure-prone,
iterative, but that seem to find knowledge in the midst of
turbulence.<br />
In short, the process is messy but fruitful.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a method that aided the creation of the
associative processes that fuel imagination.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I reached some organizational principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong><em>Everything must connect to
everything.</em></strong><br />
Instead of silos, let’s create a linked system, that you can traverse in
its entirety just by querying the available data points. This leads me
right to the second point, that is:<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Information should be combined.</em></strong><br />
As the ancients from the East have said, time and again, identity is an
illusion.<br />
The database model reificates this error of perception, by leading us in
mistaking the starkly separated, non-fungible, classes needed to catalog
and store information, as having ontological reality. Not letting us see
them as the simple artefacts of <em>count</em> and <em>store</em>
processes that they really are.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing a poem of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin">Philip Larkin</a>:
<em>they don’t mean to; but they do</em>.</p>
<p>Truth is,<br />
at least for me,<br />
and I’m the only one here;<br />
is that information has a deeply transient and context-dependent nature.
To take it from this rich and dynamic environment, cristallyzes it to
death.<br />
This is not the database’s fault.<br />
They were never meant as templates for the architecture of
thought.<br />
They are, and rightly so, intent on preserving and protecting
information.<br />
All laudable objectives, but not very amenable to fostering use or
growth.</p>
<p>The problems come from living with these tools, for so long, so
absent mindedly, and so <em>innate</em> is their presence, that we seem
them as natural occurrences and first principles.<br />
But they’re not. And we must be vigilant to not let ourselves be
subsumed in the logic of the tool.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>There is no such thing as too much
depth.</em></strong><br />
Rabbit holes are there to be followed. If I want to drill down on a
package dependencies and follow who depends on whom, for as long as the
thread may run, I should.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To get to the heights of these lofty ideals, I created a structure
around a globally available data source, that I called, with a lot of
hubris, <code>allinfo</code>. Passing through it, are function loops
that, aided by a group of collectively available helper methods, extract
information in a dynamic, associative way.<br />
The structure is composed of the following elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong><em>Query reception.</em></strong><br />
Where we make available, and incentivize its use, several data points,
heterogeneous in nature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Data management.</em></strong><br />
What I call <em>data management</em> is the still, compartmentalized,
treatment of each option of the query; with the objectives of:<br />
2.1. converting it into a <em>SQL</em> expression,<br />
2.2. clean the output,<br />
2.3. return a file with its findings.<br />
For each option there is a specific management module. Although they
share all important functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Initial funnel.</em></strong><br />
A sequence of functions that:<br />
3.1. <em>Check for availability of management information.</em> They see
if the files that have their output are present. If they find at least
one, a list is made of the files.<br />
3.2. <em>Aggregate the found information</em>. It’s the birth of
<code>allinfo</code>. All the information needed during a session is
here.<br />
3.3. <em>User’s choice.</em> Of this retrieved pack of data, the user
will choose what he wants to see. Usually is always a subset.<br />
3.4. <em>Visualizing the data.</em> The user is presented with the
content of its choices. Based on this knowledge he’ll be:<br />
3.5. <em>Asked what he wants to do with it.</em> At the moment I have
built two data loops that consume these results. The user can choose one
or the two, but they’ll always be present in the others loop, making
cross referencing the two data sources, almost inevitable.</p>
<p>They are:<br />
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Dependencies.</em></strong><br />
This loop will scan through package dependencies, for one or more
packages, drilling into its required files, as deep as the user wants.
As I said, at any moment this information can be crossed with the other
loop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Locations.</em></strong><br />
If you want to see a package location on the computer. If you say yes,
it’ll open the directory and ask you if you want to open any file. This
process can be repeated as many times as you want, or interrupted to
search for more dependencies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The only thing I haven’t mentioned, are the methods that power these
loops.<br />
There’s an interesting collection of little, some not so little,
functions to aid them on their endeavours. Some have proven so useful,
that I’m thinking in putting them in the <em>reusable_files</em>
directory, so I can access them whenever I want.</p>
<p>I leave you with a diagram of what I see when I talk about the
architecture of this solution:</p>
