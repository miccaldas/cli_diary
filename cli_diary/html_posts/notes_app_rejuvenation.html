        <p>I just completed some deep and interesting changes to the Notes app,
            that I would like to talk to you about.<br />
            Notes, on account of being the most used, the most taken care off, the
            most on demand app I have, has suffered from an overabundance of
            attention.<br />
            This made it the most likely space for experimentation and code
            decoration, for spurious reasons.<br />
            It had a lot of code that would have very little practical use, the code
            seemed to be trying new things, every three lines, and it was obvious
            that many things were tried, and some of them failed.<br />
            Lately I’ve been using more cli applications, and if until very recently
            I had always preferred a TUI interface, anything not to memorize
            commands, I’ve come to know, and love <a
                                                        href="https://click.palletsprojects.com">Click</a> framework, that
                                                    taught me to trust <code>--help</code>.<br />
                                                    I like more and more the simplicity of stating your arguments in one
                                                    fell swoop, and the increased speed of not only time spent in task, but
                                                    also in loading and unloading. It’s just a snappier alternative. And
                                                    this was something that Notes was badly needing. I created several
                                                    analytical tools to study tags and posts, that revealed themselves of no
                                                    use added value; only able to create more bloat and add to loading time.
                                                    Also the code style was the most ancient in my portfolio.</p>
        <p>Wanting to make it much better than it was, I set about to:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li><h4>
                    <u>Get back to basics</u>
                </h4>
                . No more analytics to satisfy idle curiosities, no more of momentary
                nice-to-have’s! If it doesn’t have a clear purpose, it’s dead
                wood.<br />
            </li>
            <li><h4>
                    <u>If it can be inputted in command line mode, it’s going to be
                        implemented as command line</u>
                </h4>
                . No more of my beloved option menus and input prompts. Now you
                memorized commands!<br />
            </li>
            <li><h4>
                    <u>Change the UI</u>
                </h4>
                . Although that was one of the strongest points of the old version, as
                it was a battle tested solution, simple but very robust; I was very open
                for some change.<br />
            </li>
            <li><h4>
                    <u>Less interactions as possible per task</u>
                </h4>
                . Up until now I was happy to noodle around with the interface, if that
                made the usage less taxing. I was creating all new pages showing
                available information, once, twice, thrice, as many times as I needed
                it. So I would never have to remember or learn nothing new. I now
                decided that the app should be, not difficult, but not easier than it
                needs to be.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As I already said, I trusted Click with all data collection duties,
            and used <a href="https://blessed.readthedocs.io/">Blessed</a> and <a
                        href="https://rich.readthedocs.io">Rich</a> to present the
                    results.<br />
                    I had some bad experiences with both some time ago; but that was more
                    result of my inexperience, and wanting them to do something they aren’t
                    made to do.<br />
                    Before this I’d been creating projects with <a
                                                                      href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/tput">Tput</a>, which is a fairly
                                                                  low-end tool. But that simplicity made it simple to grasp and, after you
                                                                  grok it, surprisingly capable. Not in the sense that I would recommend
                                                                  it as a framework, but as a learning opportunity.<br />
                                                                  Now, all things seemed simpler and easier to achieve; although that’s
                                                                  also because I was asking for simple things. Which helps.<br />
                                                                  I also deleted a lot files and flattened a lot of folders, reaching a
                                                                  much clear and maintainable project structure.</p>
